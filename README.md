# Maze-Generator-and-Solver

This program uses backtracking to generate a maze. Uses hashing in a custom implementation of an ordered hashtable to store the elements.
This hashtable functions as the queue or stack for the methods in the program. Object oriented design approach. This project was designed
as an improvement on my pathfinding project. Although not as many features, the new maze generator is much more efficient and the code
is much more organized.

To start, the user has to select two point in the maze. After selecting the two points the maze is automatically generated.

Clicking again will have the program use breadth first search to solve the maze and display the path.
